# Task 08  Oct 30 Checkpoint

**Whats implemented**
- Prompt matrix + IDs; compiled prompts shared across all conditions.
- Framing variants (neutral/positive/negative + confirm-primed plan).
- Manual, API-free logging sheet + simulated outputs.
- First-pass sentiment proxy and variant comparison plot.

**Whats next**
- Replace simulations with 3 real responses per variant/model label.
- Extend analysis with per-metric mentions (off/def) and confirmation-priming agreement rates.
- Add basic claim-validation checks vs anonymized stats.
